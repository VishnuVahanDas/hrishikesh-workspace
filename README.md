# Hrishikesh Workspace

This repository acts as a container for multiple git submodules that hold the main application code.

To set up this project after cloning, initialize and update the submodules with:

```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

The directories `hrishikesh` and `hrishikesh-dashboard` will then contain their respective codebases.
